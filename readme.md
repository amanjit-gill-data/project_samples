# Project Samples

## Overview

This is a collection of artefacts demonstrating my skills in data analysis and machine learning. I used various tools within Python, R and Excel; the `.pdf` reports were compiled from LaTEX.

Some of the source code is included within the reports, but most of it is contained in *private* repositories in order to prevent plagiarism as prohibited by UNSW. I will eventually remove all references to UNSW course names so that I can publish my work in its entirety. In the mean time, if you would like to have access to any source code, please email me at amanjit.github@proton.me.
